# okh-character-generator
This is a simple test of the OKH framework.

## Basic Idea

The basic idea is to create 3 test documents in OKH framework. The "hardware" described will be 3x5 cards with hand-drawn images obeying a certain standard. They will in fact be used to generate a "head", "torso", and "legs" of a random character. The idea is that they will be interchangable, probably humorously.

## The Head

The Head should be drawn in black ink with a bold pen on a 3x5 card held horizontally. At the bottom is a "neck interface" consisting of black vertical lines
drawn from the bottom of the card upward. The lines should be exactly 1" apart, and extend at least a 1/4" of an upward. The lines should be centered.
 These lines should connect to a representation of a head in whatever style the creator wants. The art should be crude and cute. 
## The Torso

The Torso should be drawn in black ink with a bold pen on a 3x5 card held horizontally. At the top is a "neck interface" consisting of black vertical lines
drawn from the top  of the card downward. The lines should be exactly 1" apart, and extend at least a 1/4" of an downward. These lines should connect to a representation of a torson in whatever style the creator wants. The art should be crude and cute.

The bottom of the torso should form two lines 1/4" inch long exactly 2" apart, centered at the bottom of the horizontal card. In between the "neck interface" and the "waist interface" you can draw whatever kind of torso you want.

## The Legs

The Legs are condsidered to begin at the waist, not the extrem bottom of the torso. The Legs card, however, is drawn  VERTICALLY. At the top, it has 2 lines at least 1/4" inch long exactly 2" apart, centered at the top. The legs do NOT need to extend to the bottom of the card. The art should be crude and cute.
